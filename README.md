# Quantifying the STEM Gender Gap

by Daniel Zayas & Ivan Rodriguez

### Summary
* 58% of college students are women
* There is no correlation between major popularity and earnings
* 7 out of 10 of the top-earning majors have 20% women or less
* All of the lowest-earning majors are majority-female, and 6 out of 10 have 80% women or more
* Grouping majors by their category, the 1) Engineering and 2) Computers & Mathematics categories have the highest earnings. They are 76% and 70% male, respectively
* Part 2 uses a timeseries dataset to show the variation in share of men/women from 1970 to 2012

### Sources
American Community Survey (ACS) conducts surveys, aggregates the data, and makes the data available to the public via the United States Census Bureau website. The raw data on earnings by college majors is available in the "2010-2012 ACS 3-year PUMS" survey, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html).  

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. Randal Olson from the University of Pennsylvania compiled this data set to explore the gender gap in STEM fields, and made the data available on his personal website [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv). Thanks Randal!
